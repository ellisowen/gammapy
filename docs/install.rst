Installation
============

To install the latest Gammapy stable version the easiest way is using the
`pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/>`_ installer:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pip install gammapy

To install the latest developer version of Gammapy, use

.. code-block:: bash

   $ git clone https://github.com/gammapy/gammapy.git
   $ cd gammapy
   $ python setup.py install --user

To check if Gammapy is correctly installed, start up python or ipython,
import Gammapy and run the unit tests:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ python -c 'import gammapy; gammapy.test()'

To check if the Gammapy command line tools are on your ``$PATH`` try this:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ gp-info --tools

Requirements
------------

Optional dependencies (imported and used only where needed):

* `scipy library <http://scipy.org/scipylib/index.html>`_ for numerical methods
* `matplotlib`_ for plotting
* `pandas`_ CVS read / write; DataFrame
* `scikit-image`_ for image processing
* `GammaLib`_ and `ctools`_ 
* `Sherpa`_ for modeling / fitting
* `ROOT`_ and `rootpy`_ conversion helper functions
* `photutils`_ for image photometry
* `Kapteyn`_ for reprojecting images
* `aplpy`_ for plotting astro images
* `imfun`_ for a trous wavelet decomposition
* `uncertainties`_ for Gaussian error propagation
* `FITS_tools`_ for reprojecting images (to replace Kapteyn in gammapy)

.. note:: I didn't put any effort into minimizing the number of dependencies ...
   I'll limit the number of optional packages if people complain about installation woes.

Sherpa
------

Some parts of Gammapy use the `Sherpa`_ Python modeling / fitting package
from the `CIAO`_ Chandra satellite X-ray data analysis package. 

Building Sherpa and all the required libraries from source is very difficult.
You should install the binary version of CIAO as described
`here <http://cxc.cfa.harvard.edu/ciao/download>`__,
make sure you include Sherpa and exclude the Chandra CALDB.
But then the Sherpa Python and Numpy will not work with the existing
Python, Numpy, Astropy, Gammapy, ... on your system.

You have to re-install Astropy, Gammapy and any other Python packages
that you want to use in the same script as Sherpa into the CIAO Python.
Sometimes this just works, but sometimes you'll run into compilation errors
when e.g. the C extensions in ``astropy.wcs`` or ``astropy.io.fits`` are compiled.

Here's a few tricks that might help you make it work.

* Execute the  
  `ciao-python-fix <http://cxc.cfa.harvard.edu/ciao/threads/ciao_install/index.html#ciao_python_fix>`__
  script after installing CIAO:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ cd $CIAO_DIR
   $ bash bin/ciao-python-fix

* Set ``LDFLAGS`` and use ``ciaorun`` before installing a Python package with C extensions:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ export LDFLAGS="-L${ASCDS_INSTALL}/ots/lib" 
   $ ciaorun python setup.py install

* Add these folders to your ``PATH`` and ``PYTHONPATH`` so that the right command line tools or
  Python packages are picked up instead of the ones in other system folders:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ export PATH=$CIAO_DIR/ots/bin:$PATH
   $ export PYTHONPATH=$CIAO_DIR/ots/lib/python2.7/site-packages/:$PYTHONPATH
